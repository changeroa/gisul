# gisul MCP server

Tiny MCP server for serving personal `SKILL.md` directories from a local machine over stdio, SSH, or Streamable HTTP.

## Layout

```text
~/gisul/
  skills/
    example/
      SKILL.md
      references/
      scripts/
```

By default, the server reads these roots in order:

- `~/gisul/skills`
- `~/.codex/skills`
- `~/.agents/skills`

Resource URIs include the source root to avoid duplicate-name collisions:

```text
skill://gisul/gisul/example/SKILL.md
skill://gisul/codex/re0/SKILL.md
skill://gisul/agents/korean-spell-check/SKILL.md
```

## Client command

Use a local machine as an on-demand MCP server over SSH:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gisul": {
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": ["your-host", "gisul"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

The canonical surface is the SEP-2640 Skills Extension (`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`):

- `skills/list`: enumerate served skills with verbatim frontmatter and per-file digest manifests
- `skills/get`: fetch one skill's entry by URI, listed or not
- `resources/read`: read any skill file as a standard MCP resource
- `resources/directory/read`: list a directory's direct children (declared via `directoryRead: true`)

Resource URIs include the source root id and the explicit file path:

```text
skill://gisul/gisul/example/SKILL.md
skill://gisul/codex/re0/SKILL.md
skill://gisul/agents/korean-spell-check/references/GUIDE.md
```

To be listed, a skill needs `SKILL.md` frontmatter with `name` and `description`, and `name` equal to the directory name (nested skills publish their own entries). Skills exceeding 512 files or 16 MiB total are skipped and logged to stderr.

The `skills_list`, `skills_get`, and `resources_read` tools are kept as a compatibility layer for older clients.

Trusted stdio/SSH connections also expose `create_skill` and `update_skill`:

- `create_skill({name, markdown, source?})` creates a top-level package with a complete YAML-frontmatter SKILL.md. The default source is the first configured root (`gisul` with default settings). Existing directories are never replaced.
- `update_skill({uri, markdown, expected_digest})` replaces only an existing SKILL.md, including nested skills. Use the exact canonical URI and `sha256:…` digest from the resource manifest (or Codex `load_skill.digest`). Supporting files are preserved. Reload and reconcile after a conflict.
- Names for new skills use lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, up to 64 characters. Frontmatter name must match the directory and description must be nonempty. Package size limits still apply.
- Updates reject symlinked skill paths. Atomic replacement avoids partial files; a per-root filesystem lock serializes cooperating SSH processes and digest checks prevent lost edits. External filesystem editors do not participate in this lock. If a process is terminated while holding `.gisul-write-lock`, an operator must verify no writer is active before removing that directory.
- HTTP remains read-only, including for existing bearer tokens. No new privileges are granted to issued HTTP clients. Writes store instruction text; they never execute it.

The Codex bridge exposes the same write tools. It requires `load_skill` before updates and retains manifest verification, so reread with `load_skill` after a successful write.

Set `GISUL_ROOT` to change the default gisul root, or use explicit source IDs to
keep existing URIs when moving content:

```sh
GISUL_SKILL_ROOTS="gisul=/absolute/path/skills;codex=/absolute/path/codex-skills" gisul
```

`GISUL_SKILL_ROOTS` uses **semicolons** between `id=absolute-directory` entries on
every platform. IDs must be unique and match `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*`. Spaces
and equals signs in directories are supported; semicolons are separators. A root
may itself be a symlink. Root ordering and directory names do not change source
IDs such as `skill://gisul/gisul/…`.

The older `GISUL_SKILLS_DIRS` remains supported with platform path delimiters
(`:` on macOS), but is deprecated because it assigns positional `root0`, `root1`
IDs. `GISUL_SKILL_ROOTS` takes precedence when both are set and reports that on
stderr. Malformed named-root configuration fails at startup rather than falling
back to different URI identities.

### Release identity and URI aliases

The server reads `${GISUL_ROOT}/release.json` on each `skills/list` and
`skills/get` request (override with `GISUL_RELEASE_FILE`). Responses include
`_meta.server_version`, and, when a release file exists, `_meta.release` and
`_meta.commit`. Requests fail if the release changes while being read. A release
that includes `skills: [{uri, manifest_digest}]` must match the served manifests;
unreleased changes cannot be reported as that release.

The manifest digest is SHA-256 of JSON containing `{uri, digest, size}` resource
records sorted by URI with ordinary string comparison. The digest has the
`sha256:` prefix. A release file may initially omit `skills` for compatibility;
published content snapshots should always include the manifests.

`${GISUL_ROOT}/aliases.json` (override with `GISUL_ALIASES_FILE`) is an object
mapping old file-explicit skill URIs to canonical URIs. `skills/get` resolves
same-server aliases and includes `_meta.movedFrom` when redirected. Alias chains
are bounded and cycles rejected. Read the returned canonical resource URIs;
resource reads do not silently redirect old file paths.

When serving through a public tunnel, set `GISUL_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to include the tunnel hostname:

```text
GISUL_ALLOWED_HOSTS=127.0.0.1,localhost,gisul-origin.example.com
```

## HTTP mode

The persistent deployment runs Streamable HTTP MCP on `127.0.0.1:8788`.

- `POST /mcp`: MCP endpoint, protected by bearer token.
- `GET /auth/request`: simple request form.
- `POST /auth/token-requests`: create a token request.
- `GET /auth/token-requests/:id?claim_token=...`: poll request status and receive the token once approved.
- `GET /dashboard`: admin approval dashboard.

Secrets live outside the repository:

```text
~/.config/secrets/gisul-mcp-bearer-token
~/.config/secrets/gisul-mcp-admin-token
```
